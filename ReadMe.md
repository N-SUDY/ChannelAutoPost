# Channel Auto-Post Bot

Use the [usermode](https://github.com/suphiozturk8/ChannelAutoPost/tree/user) branch, if you want to forward messages without being an admin in the from channel.

This bot can send all new messages from channels, directly to another set of channels (or group, just in case), without the forwarded tag!

## Setting up 
* First:
> `APP_ID` and `API_HASH` - Get it from my.telegram.org   
> `BOT_TOKEN` - Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)   
> `FROM_CHANNEL` - The IDs of the main channel from where posts have to be copied, split by space. eg: `-100xxxx -100yyyy -100abcd ...`   
> `TO_CHANNEL` - The ID of the channel to which the posts are to be sent, split by space. eg: `-100xxxx -100yyyy -100abcd ...`
